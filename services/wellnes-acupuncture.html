                <h2>Integrative Acupuncture for Wellness</h2>
                <p>For many of us when we get sick or become injured, we go to see our doctor and are usually prescribed
                    medication or provided another type of treatment. Although this conventional modality of medicine helps
                    many, it does not always prove to be effective for everyone. Patients can be left feeling hopeless when
                    all of their options have seemingly been used up, and they don’t know what the next step is in their
                    healing process. More recently acupuncture has been recognized as an integrative therapy that can be
                    included within many patient’s treatment plan and fill the void in these situations. It has been observed
                    through research that acupuncture has been proven to help treat:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pain and inflammation</li>
                    <li>Gastrointestinal disorders</li>
                    <li>Mental/ Emotional disorders</li>
                    <li>Aids metabolism</li>
                    <li>Insomnia</li>
                    <li>Boosts Immunity</li>
                    <li>Fertility</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every patient’s disease pattern is unique, which means that every treatment will be different.
                    Customized acupuncture protocols will be implemented after every patient has provided an in-depth
                    health history intake, and all details have been accounted for.</p>
