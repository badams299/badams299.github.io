                        <p>Dating back around 4000 years from China, Acupuncture is based on energies through the human
                            body and the balance in these energies are believed to be essential to one’s health. The two
                            energies guiding the acupuncture is the balance in the Yin and Yang.</p>
                        <p>Besides, the equilibrium in the yin and yang, TCM is also based on the concept of the flow of energy throughout the body; this concept is also known as the Chi or Qi. The disruption of the energy may hence cause, pain and internal disease.</p>
